npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Build (production)

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a `build/` folder with the production assets.

There is also a `build:ci` script used for CI environments where some local NODE_OPTIONS are not allowed:

```bash
npm run build:ci
```

## Deployment

Two simple deployment options:

- Automatic (recommended): Enable the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. When present and enabled, it builds the app and deploys the `build/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on pushes to `main`.

- Manual: Run `npm run build` locally and publish the `build/` folder via GitHub Pages (repository settings) or your preferred hosting provider.

Choose one method — automatic deploy is convenient; manual deploy keeps CI off.

## Project Structure

├── .github/             # Optional CI workflow (auto-deploy)
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml
├── build/               # Generated production build (do not commit)
├── public/              # Static files (source)
│   └── index.html

├── .env.example         # Example env vars (optional)
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

## Available Commands

- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm start` — start local dev server
- `npm run build` — build production assets
- `npm run build:ci` — CI-friendly build (no NODE_OPTIONS)

## Notes on dependencies and security

- The app uses `react-scripts` for build tooling. Running `npm install` may report developer-time vulnerabilities via `npm audit` that come from build tooling. These affect the development/build environment and not the production runtime served to users. If you need help resolving audit findings (reducing them to zero), I can attempt safe upgrades or dependency pinning and test the build.

## Troubleshooting

- Port 3000 already in use: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PORT`.
- If the dev server or build fails, run `npm install` then `npm run build:ci` and share the error.

## Recent repository cleanup

- Removed Netlify configuration and one-time deployment scripts; this project now targets GitHub Pages only.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that builds and deploys `build/` to `gh-pages` on pushes to `main`. This is optional — you can delete the workflow and use manual deploy if you prefer.
- Removed the `gh-pages` local deploy package and scripts to keep the repo simple.

If you'd like a different deployment flow (manual only, CI off, or GitHub Pages API-based deploy), I can adjust it.

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Lucide React (icons)
- HTML5 Canvas API
- GitHub Pages (hosting)

## Usage

1. **Add Players**: Click "Attacker" or "Defender" buttons to add players
2. **Position Players**: Click/tap and drag players to position them
3. **Assign Ball**: Select a player and click "Give Ball"
4. **Create Keyframes**: Click "Add Keyframe" to create animation frames
5. **Animate**: Adjust speed and press Play to watch your play unfold!

## Available Commands

- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm start` — start dev server (local development)
- `npm run build` — create production build locally (uses `NODE_OPTIONS` for local storage workaround)
- `npm run build:ci` — CI build without `NODE_OPTIONS` (used by the workflow)
- `npm test` — run tests (if any)

Notes:
- We removed `npm run deploy`; the repository either uses the GitHub Actions workflow to auto-deploy, or you can deploy the `build/` folder manually to GitHub Pages.
- The `build/` folder is generated by `npm run build` and should not be committed (it's in `.gitignore`).

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a different port:
```
PORT=3001
```

### localStorage Error on Startup
The project is configured to handle Node.js 22+ localStorage requirements.
If you still see errors, make sure you ran `npm install` to get all dependencies.

### Slider Track Not Visible
Try:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try a different browser

### Changes Not Showing After Deploy
1. Wait 2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
2. Hard refresh your browser
3. Clear browser cache
